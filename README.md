# Credit Risk Analysis with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective:
Analyzed loan application data to identify patterns and key indicators of loan default, enhancing decision-making in loan approvals to minimize financial risk.

## Dataset:
application_data.csv: Client information at the time of loan application.
previous_application.csv: Clientâ€™s previous loan details (approved, cancelled, refused, unused).
columns_description.csv: Data dictionary for the dataset.

## Tasks Performed:
### Data Cleaning:
  * Identified and handled missing values appropriately.
  * Detected and addressed outliers.
### Data Analysis:
  * Conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to understand data distributions and relationships.
  * Analyzed data imbalance and its impact on model performance.
  * Segmented data to find top correlations for clients with and without payment difficulties.
### Insights Extraction:
  * Determined key factors influencing loan default.
  * Highlighted significant client and loan attributes affecting default risk.
  * Visualized findings using various plots to support decision-making.

## Skills and Technologies:
